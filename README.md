## Translations

This repository contains the translation files for the Form Tools core.

### How to install

- Copy the appropriate `.php` language file from the /core folder and upload it to `/global/lang/` 
within your Form Tools folder on your website.
- Next, log into Form Tools and go to the Accounts &raquo; Settings tab.
- There, click the "Refresh List" button. If you uploaded the file to the correct folder, the dropdown will now 
contain the new language option.
- Now, if you wish, change the default language. This will be used as the default language for all future client 
accounts and for any non-logged in user viewing your login page.
- If you need to change the language for your own account, click the "Your Account" link in the left menu and select the new language.
- Drink a pi√±a colada. You're done.

### Help translate! 

We LOVE to get help with the translations! A lot of the translations were originally made with Google Translate so 
they're pretty poor. The easiest way to do translate is edit the file right on the github site (you'll need an account). If 
you're not sure what the original text was, take a look at the original [en_us.php](core/en_us.php) file - that contains 
all of the original translation strings.
